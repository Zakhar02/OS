Recovery
We can try to take away a preemptive resources causing the deadlcok, 
we can also use rollback, which means creating snapshots during runtime to return to them.
It also can kill process.

Prevention
Exclude at least 1 conndition of deadlcok.

Avoidance
Best way of dealing with deadlocks since doesn't requare to limit resources.
Schheduling algorithm required. Works only if we can say is resource safe or not.
